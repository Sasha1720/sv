<p>Lockheed SR-71 "Blackbird" - American supersonic reconnaissance 
     aircraft of the Cold War . Able to develop speeds over
      Mach 3 and reach significant flight altitudes .</p>

      <p>Air intakes and engines The air intakes are one of the most important functional components of the Lockheed SR-71 design, they helped the aircraft to fly at speeds over 3300 km / h, and at the same time fly at subsonic speeds using the same type of turbojet engines. In front of the air intakes there are movable nose fairings for engines, which are in the extended position at speeds up to 1.6 M. At higher speeds, the cone is pushed in and the direct current motor is activated [5] . The supersonic air flow is pre-compressed, forming shock waves on the outer part of the central body-cone - the flow velocity decreases, due to which its static pressure and temperature increase. Then the air enters a 4-stage compressor, where the air flow is separated: part of it passes into the compressor (air "main flow"), while another flow bypasses the core to enter the afterburner. The air that passes further through the compressor is compressed before entering the combustion chamber, where it mixes with the fuel and ignites. The flow temperature reaches its maximum in the combustion chamber: slightly below the temperature from which the turbine blades would begin to lose their strength. The air is cooled by passing through the turbine and connected to the bypass air before entering the afterburner [6]. Within Mach 3, the preliminary inhibition (compression) of the supersonic flow in conical shock waves leads to a significant increase in its temperature. This means that the turbojet part of the engine must reduce the fuel / air ratio in the combustion chamber so as not to melt the turbine blades further downstream. The turbojet components of the engine thus provide much less thrust, and 80% of the thrust of the engine is provided by air, which bypasses most turbines and enters the afterburner, where it ignites, creating jet thrust in the rear surface of the nozzle [6] </p>
